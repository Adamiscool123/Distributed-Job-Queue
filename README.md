Distributed Job Queue System (DJQS)

A low-latency, horizontally scalable, and pure C++ job distribution system.
Designed for asynchronous task handling across multiple Workers — with full thread safety.

<br>
Overview

The Distributed Job Queue System (DJQS) solves a critical distributed-systems challenge:

How do multiple Clients and Workers safely read/write the same queue at the same time?

The project demonstrates modern C++ concurrency design, safe shared-resource access, socket communication, and scalable worker orchestration.

<br>
Architecture & Data Flow

DJQS follows the classic Client → Server → Worker flow.

Client — Sends jobs

Server — Stores & dispatches jobs

Workers — Continuously pull & execute jobs

<br>
Components
Component	Role	Technologies
Server (Queue Boss)	Thread-safe job queue manager. Dispatches jobs to Workers.	Sockets, std::thread, std::mutex, std::queue
Client (Request Maker)	Sends tasks to the Server and disconnects after ACK.	Sockets
Worker (Processor)	Pulls and processes tasks using simulated delays.	Sockets, sleep()
<br>
Concurrency (The Real C++ Challenge)

The Server must prevent race conditions when multiple Workers try to pop from the queue.

Problem

Two Workers grabbing the first item at the same time → corrupted queue, crashes, undefined behavior.

Solution

Wrap every queue access inside a mutex lock.

<br>
C++ Example
void Server::dispatchJob() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(queue_mutex_);  // LOCK

    if (!job_queue_.empty()) {
        std::string job = job_queue_.front();
        job_queue_.pop();
        // Send job to Worker
    }
}  // UNLOCK automatically happens here

🛠️ Installation
Prerequisites

GCC/G++ with C++11+

make (optional)

<br>
Compile Everything
g++ server.cpp -o server -std=c++17 -pthread
g++ client.cpp -o client -std=c++17 -pthread
g++ worker.cpp -o worker -std=c++17 -pthread

<br>
How to Run

Open multiple terminals:

Terminal	Command	Purpose
1	./server	Start the Server
2	./worker	Worker A
3	./worker	Worker B
4	./client	Send tasks
<br>
Sample Client Commands

Use these inside the Client terminal:

TASK: CALCULATE_FINANCE: 5s_delay
TASK: CLEANUP_LOGS: 2s_delay
TASK: SEND_NOTIFICATION: 1s_delay


Workers will log the job they receive and sleep() to simulate real processing time.
